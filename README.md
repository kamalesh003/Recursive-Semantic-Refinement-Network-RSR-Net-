#  Recursive Semantic Refinement Network (RSR-Net)

## Project Goal
The **Recursive Semantic Refinement Network (RSR-Net)** is an innovative approach to abstractive summarization. Instead of generating text word-by-word, RSR-Net is designed to iteratively refine a fixed-size semantic embedding of a summary until it converges to the desired output state, which is semantically close to the ground-truth summary. This technique leverages principles from Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

They were married for two years, but separated after just 10 months of marriage\n\nMusk - whom the New York Times called\n'Tony Stark without the Iron Man suit' - is paying off his second wife \nover the course of nine years, TMZ reported.\n\nBut, in the interim, Riley gets to \nkeep her Cartier and Gucci watches, an assortment of diamond jewellery \nand her $110,000 Tesla Roadster. She received $1.4 million up front as \nan initial payoff, according to court documents.\n\nContent: Ms Riley's lawyers aren't contesting the meager settlement\n\nMusk, a South African who attended \nthe University of Pennsylvania, made his fortune by founding a series of\nhighly successful ventures - beginning with Zip2, which produced online\ncontent publishing software that was purchased in 1999 for nearly $340 \nmillion.\n\nLater, for his next venture, Musk helped create PayPal, the online money transfer and payment service.\n\nEbay bought PayPal for $1.2 billion in 2002. Musk founded Space X later that year - an outer space exploration company.\n\nIn 2009, the company launched the first privately owned liquid-fuelled rocket ever to enter space.\n\nSpace X now has a contract to deliver cargo to the International Space Station that is worth between $1.6-$3.1 billion.\n\nMusk also founded Tesla Motors, an \nelectric car company that had a $226 million initial public offering in \n2010. For all his wealth, Riley seems content with the $4.2 million \nfigure.\n\nHer lawyers haven't contested the \noffer from Musk, age 41 - which amounts to a little more than pocket \nchange for a man who spends a reported $200,000 a month on personal \nexpenses.\n\nIn 2010, Musk finalised the divorce \nwith his first wife, Canadian fantasy novelist Justine Musk, who is the \nmother of his two sons.\n\nHe had been with Riley for four years before they separated in July 2011.\n\n@highlight\n\nElon Musk has is divorcing Talulah Riley, a 26-year-old British actress, after two years of marriage\n\n@highlight\n\nMr Must -- called Tony Stark without the Iron Man suit -- has founded four successful companies including Telsa Motors and Space X\n\n@highlight\n\nMs Riley gets to keep her Cartier and Gucci watches, diamond jewelry and her $110,00 Tesla Roadster", "Brendan Rodgers admitted that his ambition is to manage a club in Spain as the Liverpool boss revealed that he is already learning more Spanish.\n\nRodgers said in a stunning interview with Spanish newspaper AS that he wants to stay in charge at Anfield for the next 20 years but has already started preparing for a move abroad one day.\n\nThe 41-year-old Northern Irishman admitted that he tries to communicate with Liverpool's Spanish players - Jose Enrique, Alberto Moreno, Suso and Javi Manquillo - in their native language, rather than English.\n\nBrendan Rodgers has given a wide-ranging interview to Spanish newspaper AS, published on Monday and the translation of the quote on the front page says: 'I've not seen a team like this Madrid for a long time'\n\nRodgers congratulates Raheem Sterling after Sunday's scrappy victory at QPR\xa0\n\nAsked by AS where he sees himself in five years' time Rodgers said: 'I don’t know, I hope one day to work in Spain.\n\n'I’ve studied Spanish, but I need to improve.
