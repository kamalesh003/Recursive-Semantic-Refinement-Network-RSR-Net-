#  Recursive Semantic Refinement Network (RSR-Net)

## Project Goal
The **Recursive Semantic Refinement Network (RSR-Net)** is an innovative approach to abstractive summarization. Instead of generating text word-by-word, RSR-Net is designed to iteratively refine a fixed-size semantic embedding of a summary until it converges to the desired output state, which is semantically close to the ground-truth summary. This technique leverages principles from Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
