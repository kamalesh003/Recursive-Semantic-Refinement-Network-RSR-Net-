#  Recursive Semantic Refinement Network (RSR-Net)

## Project Goal
The **Recursive Semantic Refinement Network (RSR-Net)** is an innovative approach to abstractive summarization. Instead of generating text word-by-word, RSR-Net is designed to iteratively refine a fixed-size semantic embedding of a summary until it converges to the desired output state, which is semantically close to the ground-truth summary (Iterative regression problem in a semantic space). This technique leverages principles from Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

A solar eruption could take out the National Grid, along with many electrical systems across the world\n\nThey are often preceded by a solar flare - a massive release of energy from the sun in the form of gamma rays, X-rays, protons and electrons.\n\nA solar superstorm occurs when a CME of sufficient magnitude tears into the Earth’s surrounding magnetic field and rips it apart.\xa0\n\nSuch an event would induce huge surges of electrical currents in the ground and in overhead transmission lines, causing widespread power outages and severely damaging critical electrical components.\n\nAshley Dale, who was a member of an international task force - dubbed Solarmax - set up to identify the risks of a solar storm and how its impact could be minimised, warned of the danger man faces from 'solar super-storms.'\n\nA solar superstorm occurs when a CME of sufficient magnitude tears into the Earth’s surrounding magnetic field and rips it apart\n\nMr Dale, carrying out doctoral research in aerospace engineering at Bristol University, said it is only a 'matter of time' before an exceptionally violent solar storm is propelled towards Earth.\n\nHe says such a storm would wreak havoc with communication systems and power supplies, crippling vital services such as transport, sanitation and medicine.\n\nSolar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost.\n\nAstronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks.\n\nThe charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field.\n\nVery large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies.\n\nA positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced.\n\nGeomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents.\n\n'Without power, people would struggle to fuel their cars at petrol stations, get money from cash dispensers or pay online,' he said.\n\n'Water and sewage systems would be affected too, meaning that health epidemics in urbanised areas would quickly take a grip, with diseases we thought we had left behind centuries ago soon returning.'\n\nThe largest ever solar super-storm on record occurred in 1859 and is known as the Carrington Event, named after the English astronomer Richard Carrington who spotted the preceding solar flare.\n\nThis massive CME released about 1022 kJ of energy - the equivalent to 10 billion Hiroshima bombs exploding at the same time - and hurled around a trillion kilos of charged particles towards the Earth at speeds of up to 3000 km/s.\n\nHowever, its impact on the human population was relatively benign as our electronic infrastructure at the time amounted to no more than about 124,000 miles (200,000 km) of telegraph lines.\n\nMr Dale makes it clear in the latest issue of Physics World that these types of events are not just a threat, but inevitable.\n\nNasa scientists have predicted that the Earth is in the path of a Carrington-level event every 150 years on average.\xa0\n\nThis means that we are currently five years overdue - and that the likelihood of one occurring in the next decade is as high as 12 per cent.\n\nThis image of a huge solar flare (top left) was captured by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). One of the most dramatic features is the way the entire surface of the sun seems to ripple with the force of the eruption\n\nThe 40-strong international team of scientists from Solarmax gathered at the International Space University in France last year to identify the best ways of limiting the potential damage of a solar super-storm.\n\nA sub-group of scientists concluded that advanced space-weather forecasting is the best solution, which could be achieved by sending an array of 16 lunchbox-sized cube satellites into orbit around the Sun.\n\nThe network could give around a week’s notice of where, when and with what magnitude solar storms will take place, providing adequate time to switch off vulnerable power lines, re-orientate satellites, ground planes and begin national recovery programmes.\n\nMr Dale’s own solution is to design spacecraft and satellites so that the sensitive, on-board instruments are better protected again sudden increases in radiation from solar storms.\n\nHe suggests redistributing the existing internal architecture of a craft so that sensitive payloads are surrounded by non-sensitive bulk material such as polyethylene, aluminium and water.\n\nMr Dale added: 'As a species, we have never been more vulnerable to the volatile mood of our nearest star, but it is well within our ability, skill and expertise as humans to protect ourselves.'\n\n\xa0\n\n@highlight\n\nHuge storms are caused by violent eruptions on the surface of the sun\xa0\n\n@highlight\n\nThey can induce surges of electrical currents in the ground on Earth\n\n@highlight\n\nA storm can also affect overhead transmission lines causing a black out\n\n@highlight\n\nWarning comes from, Ashley Dale, a member of the Solarmax task force\xa0\n\n@highlight\n\nSolarmax was set up to find out how to reduce the impact of solar storms\n\n@highlight\n\nMr Dale says it is only a 'matter of time' before an exceptionally violent solar storm is propelled towards Earth", "On paper it looks like the holy trinity of an attacking midfield, but Louis van Gaal's decision to play Adnan Januzaj and Angel di Maria either side of Juan Mata on Monday night may not be one he makes again.\n\nDespite 90 minutes of nail-biting action, the first 30 minutes were most telling, and set the tone for the remainder of the game while summing up Manchester United's season so far.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion dominated United for the opening period, leading the game at the half-hour mark and leading every physical battle to boot.\n\nMORE HEAT MAPS AND STATS FROM SPORTSMAIL'S MATCH ZONE SERVICE HERE\n\nAngel di Maria started on the left wing for Manchester United, providing the assist for Marouane Fellaini\n\nDi Maria caused problems on the left, and often moved infield to penetrate West Brom's defence\n\nPart of the problem was the load on midfielder Daley Blind as United attempted to spring forward using the three-pronged attacking midfield of Januzaj, Mata and Di Maria.\n\nJanuzaj, starting his first game under Van Gaal and not known for his defensive capabilities, was cemented to the right wing for the first-half, moving slightly inward in the second-half as United improved ever so slightly.\n\nMata, playing in the absence of the suspended Wayne Rooney, saw very little of the ball throughout, and was bypassed by United's deeper midfielders and defence.\xa0\n\nMORE HEAT MAPS AND STATS FROM SPORTSMAIL'S MATCH ZONE SERVICE HERE\xa0\n\nJuan Mata started in the middle of the three-pronged attacking midfield at the Hawthorns\n\nMata spent much of the first-half helping Adnan Januzaj on the right of midfield, and struggled to impact\n\nOn the opposite wing Di Maria was not an individual problem. In fact the Argentine was superb again, providing the assist for Marouane Fellaini's equaliser and delivering several dangerous balls having found himself in space.\n\nHe did exactly what Januzaj didn't when 'stuck out' on the wing - making use of the situation to full effect - with the Belgian picking up a 5.5/10 rating bySportsmail. Di Maria at least attempted to move in and penetrate the penalty area more than once, as shown in his heat map.\n\nMata, meanwhile, is an ongoing dilemma - a £37.5million midfielder without a defined place in Van Gaal's system to justify the price tag - and it showed again at the Hawthorns.\n\nMORE HEAT MAPS AND STATS FROM SPORTSMAIL'S MATCH ZONE SERVICE HERE\xa0\n\nJanuzaj, on his first start for United under Van Gaal, hardly had an effect on the game on the right wing\n\nThe Belgian hugged the right wing for United, and his delivery into the box was often poor\n\nThe only man directly between Mata and goal, striker Robin van Persie, was given no support by the Spaniard and nothing to feed off. The two played too far apart, forcing (or enabling, Van Gaal would argue) United to use the flanks even more.\xa0\n\nToo wide and not clinical enough, United were stretched.\xa0Space behind the striker that Rooney would often fill was vacant, meaning United struggled to win the ball high up the pitch.\xa0\n\nAlbion's only roadblock to goal when winning the ball in midfield was an out-of-position Ander Herrera and an exposed Blind.\n\nThe Januzaj-Mata-Di Maria trio made just one tackle between them, compared to five by West Brom's attacking midfield three of Chris Brunt, Stephane Sessegnon and Graham Dorrans.\n\nIt was no surprise both goals came on the break with the  trio chasing shadows, and the second goal in particular cut through the heart of United, as can be seen below.\n\nMORE HEAT MAPS AND STATS FROM SPORTSMAIL'S MATCH ZONE SERVICE HERE\xa0\n\nWest Brom's second goal, scored by Saido Berahino (18) came from United being cut right down the middle\n\nFellaini was brought on for the second half and had a big impact on the match, scoring the equaliser\n\nVan Persie was often playing off the last West Brom man, but Mata struggled to connect with him\n\nVan Gaal got his tactics wrong at 8pm, but the game quickly changed complexion after the first-half.\n\nAs is not often the case, there weren't too many question marks over Fellaini's introduction at the expense of Herrera at half-time, giving Blind more physical support. It worked in an attacking sense, too.\n\nUnited finally had some control going forward, but none when tracking back.

After going to the College of Charleston (during which time she met Southern Charm castmate Shep Rose) she moved to Telluride, Colorado to ski and met James Maby when she was 24.\n\nScroll down for video\xa0\n\nThe Southern Charm cast photo for Season Two includes one new face, Landon, seen here in the white dress\n\nLandon claims she was swept off her feet by a self-proclaimed ‘James Bond Brit.’ After they met, they got married in Charleston and then she moved with him to Los Angeles. She never names him on the show or on the Bravo website, but she shared a few photos on the series' second episode\n\nThe pair were together for seven years, she told Southern Charm cameras, while photos showed snippets of their glamorous time together.\xa0\n\nBut she said it was also terribly lonely, so lonely that she left him and California behind.\n\n‘I was living the dream. We had a house in the [Hollywood] Hills, swimming pool, staff, the cars, the jewels. When I moved out of the house I pretty much just walked away from all of it….\xa0\n\n'On the inside I was so alone, so I packed up and left. Sometimes you just have to save yourself,' she told the camera as she choked back tears.\n\nNo more bling: ‘I was living the dream. We had a house in the  Hills, swimming pool, staff, the cars, the jewels,' Landon said on Southern Charm. She shared this photo of an impressive looking engagement ring, right\n\nMaby's first wife Stacey Dash, seen left in 1995's Clueless, had a sizable looking diamond ring herself in 2005, at right, which was around the time she married to Maby after giving birth to their daughter\n\nMaby, 43, is an Etonian who claims to speak five languages and was married to Stacey Dash from 2005 to 2006.\xa0\n\nThe pair share a daughter Lola, 11, together. He is the CEO of Sports Logistics, an international firm which does sport branding and billboards and travels a lot for his job.\n\nFrom Landon’s bio on the Bravo website it would seem there isn't a lot of love lost between the pair, as she branded him in part an 'international man of not much mystery.'\xa0\n\nAn excerpt reads:\n\n‘During this time she met a self-proclaimed ‘James Bond Brit.’ The international man of not much mystery swept her off her feet and they married in Charleston. The demands of their careers compounded with the duties for his actress ex-wife and young daughter became too much for the pair and they separated.’\n\nThe bio never names him or Dash.\xa0\n\nBut then she choked up while telling the cameras about her live with James Maby. Despite the sunny Los Angeles weather, Landon says her life was incredibly lonely\xa0\n\nMaby's life in Los Angeles also includes daughter Lola, 11, whom he had with ex-wife Stacey Dash. One time Clueless star Dash, who has been married three times, also has son Austin, 23, pictured at right with his mom and sister\n\nAfter Landon and James pair split in 2013, Landon spent the winter in Aspen and arrived back in Charleston to ‘reclaim her life’ in 2014 – coincidentally just in time to join the Bravo show which filmed last summer.\n\nBut Landon doesn't just have friends on reality shows already. Lke Shep, she has an ex-husband with plenty of experience himself, and she no doubt knew more than most what she would be getting into by joining the Bravo hit.\n\nHer ex-husband James Maby was a repeat winner on the largely forgotten British reality show Lost, which aired for just one season the fall of 2001.\n\nOn Lost two strangers were paired together, given almost no money and just three days' rations, and were parachuted while blind folded into an unknown destination - including Azerbaijan and Mali.\n\nAll they knew was their final destination, and they had to find there way to it.\xa0\n\nLandon's ex James Maby as seen on the opening credits, in 2001, from the British reality show Lost\n\nOn the show Maby and his teammate, an until-the-show stranger named Harriet Bulwer-Long, were dropped alongside two other teams in an unknown destination with little food or money. Here they take their blindfolds off upon being left in Newfoundland\n\nHe worked his posh accent and knowledge of languages to his advantage. His team also had the benefit of his family apartment on Fifth Avenue, where they stayed one night while passing through New York with no money, seen right. That apartment was sold in 2004, before he met Landon\n\nOne episode saw James negotiating the price of his camel ride to Timbuktu, seen here, before complaining that the saddle hurt his privates\n\nMaby was also rampant flirt and a charmer during his time on the show, smiling when the women here answered that he was\n\nHe won multiple times, and celebrated each time with the classic champagne pop and crowd spray upon reaching Trafalgar Square\n\nEach race contained three teams, and each team had a cameraman in tow. On all but the season finale the teams were competing to be first back to London's Trafalgar Square.\n\nThey had to beg and borrow and talk their way into freebies - including plane tickets - to survive.\n\nMaby, who skis and claims to speak five languages, thrived.\xa0\n\nThe first team back to Trafalgar Square won, and got to go on the adventure again. Maby won multiple rounds and featured prominently throughout the season.\n\nCameras followed as he and show partner Harriet Bulwer-Long\xa0traversed on camel back to Timbuktu, found his way out of Newfoundland, and borrowed money off old school friends in New York where his father conveniently had an apartment on Fifth Avenue.\xa0\n\nAs a repeat winner he had a large amount of screen time, but he receded from the spotlight when the show went off the air.\n\nNo doubt he would have good advice for his ex on how to win over viewers on reality television if the pair still speak.\n\nBut it's unclear if they are on speaking terms, and Maby appears to have bounced right back from his second divorce and into a new relationship.\xa0\n\nAs of August 2013 his Facebook status has been ‘in a relationship’ with Kam Heskin, 41, a sometime actress and publicist for jewelry companies.\n\n\xa0Maby seems to have moved on from Landon with no problem.

The last World War I veteran, Frank Buckles, died in 2011.\n\nDoughboys: The last of the American World War I veterans have described the perils of war, the emotional toll of fighting and the celebration of the armistice in a new book spotlighting their stories\n\nAs he tried to track down the former soldiers, he was often met with disappointment, finding out that the man or woman he was looking to speak with was no longer alive.\n\nRubin told NPR that on one occasion, he discovered a 108-year-old vet who was alive and 'clear-minded,' but when Rubin showed up two weeks later, the man was unconscious in the hospital\n\nHe died the next day.\n\nBut dozens more were alive, well and willing to share their stories.\n\nThere was Arthur Fiala, who was 106 when he spoke to Mr Rubin. Mr Fiala spoke of his eagerness to pack his bags and join the Allies.\n\nAnticipation: Arthur Fiala, who was 106 when he spoke to Mr Rubin, spoke of his eagerness in his youth to pack his bags and join the Allies\n\nMr Fiala, who was from Wisconsin, said: 'I \nwent to Green Bay and enlisted in the army. And the big war was on then.\nI said I want to get over to France quick.\n\n'You pick out the place where\nyou want me to go. The place where I can be. Wherever I can be used, \nthat's where I want to go.'\n\nAnthony Pierro, 107 at the time of his interview with Rubin, disagreed, saying that the Army is 'a miserable life.'\n\nHe said: 'You can't do anything... on your own. They tell you what to do.'\n\nAt one point, Mr Pierro said the best part of his time in World War I was being in the French city of Bordeaux.\n\nTrouble with war: Anthony Pierro, 107 at the time of his interview with Mr Rubin, disagreed, saying that the Army is 'a miserable life'\n\n'The girls used to say, 'upstairs, two dollars.'\n\nBut you didn't go upstairs, his nephew Rick interjected.\n\n'I didn't have the two dollars.' Mr Pierro replied.\n\nHoward Ramsey, who was 105 when he spoke to Mr Rubin in 2003, said that he and his colleagues were at one time so ill-prepared for the cold that they resorted to sleeping in a cemetery.\n\nHe said:\xa0 'So I remember one \nnight, it was cold, and we had no blankets, or nothing like that. We had\nto sleep.\n\n'We slept in the cemetery, because we could sleep between the\ntwo graves, and keep the wind off of us.'\n\nRecollections: Howard Ramsey, who was 105 when he spoke to Mr Rubin in 2003, said that he and his colleagues were at one time so ill-prepared for the cold that they resorted to sleeping in a French cemetery\n\nCourage under fire: J. Laurence Moffitt, 106 at the time of this interview said he and his colleagues 'lived' under enemy fire, and 'disregarded it' after a while\n\nWhen asked whether he came under artillery fire often during WWI, J. Laurence Moffitt, 106 at the time, replied: 'All the time. We lived under it... After a while, you disregarded it.'\n\nMr Moffitt added that he had been 'severely gassed several times - but I never went to medical for it.'\n\nWilliam J. Lake, who was 107 when he sat down with Mr Rubin, perhaps came the closest to losing his life during the war in one of the most poignant stories told.\n\nMr Lake also fought at the Meuse-Argonne offensive, the deadliest battle in American history.\n\n'Well I'll tell ya, just bullets zipping around you all the time,' he said. 'You \njust never knew when you was going to get hit. but I was lucky.'\n\nHe told Mr Rubin: 'Another guy and I were sitting on a bank and a sniper shot him \ninstead of me... We was no more than two feet apart and he picked him \ninstead of me. He killed him of course.'\n\nLucky one: William J. Lake, who was 107 when he sat down with Mr Rubin, talked about how he was sitting with a fellow soldier when he was suddenly shot by a sniper. He said that the shooter 'picked him instead of me'\n\nHe said that the allied forces later found the shooter in a tree and [killed] him.\n\n'Oh yeah. They didn't take [snipers] prisoner.'\n\nHildegarde Schan, at 107, saw a different side of the war as a young woman.\n\nAfter working for the War Department in Washington, she was worked for the Veterans Bureau in New York after the armistice.\n\nIt was the place where those who had served in the war went to collect their paychecks - and often received bad news.\n\nEmpathy: Hildegarde Schan, at 107, saw a different side of the war as a young woman, dealing with returning soldiers - some without arms or legs - looking to get paid by the Veterans Bureau\n\nSickness: Reuben Law - 105 at the time of the interview -- said he was apart of a convoy en route to France in 1918 when a deadly flu epidemic struck\n\nShe told Rubin: 'It was very sad... You see them coming in with one leg or one arm... I couldn't take it anymore - to see them come in.\n\nShe added: 'They'd borrow on their check and they'd have to pay it back next month and they didn't have any money then.'\n\nWhen the war ended with Armistice Day on November 11, 1918, George Briant wasn't celebrating. In fact, he was mourning.\n\nHe said that he had seen a group of men \ntake shelter in a wooded area before it was shot up by enemy soldiers, \nkilling most of them.\n\nSurvivor: Frank Buckles, the final World War I veteran, outlived 4.7million other U.S. servicemen before he died at age 110 in March 2011\n\nMr Briant, 103 during his interview, said: 'Such fine, handsome, healthy young men, to be killed on the last night of the war. I cried for their parents.'\n\nReuben Law - 105 at the time of the \ninterview -- said he was apart of a convoy en route to France in 1918 \nwhen a deadly flu epidemic struck.\n\nHe told Mr Rubin: 'I think we were in the \nwater for 21 days... The thing about the trip across was the flu, and there were 91 who died aboard ship.\n\nHe said they converted the dining room of a ship to a hospital, where the sick soldiers had to sleep on tables.\n\nMr Buckles, the final World War II veteran, outlived 4.7million other U.S. \nWorld War I servicemen before he died at age 110 in March 2011.\n\nBut unlike the others, Buckles did not see World War I combat - at least not yet.\n\nIn World War II, Buckles was captured by the Japanese in Manila and was held for three years as a prisoner of war.\n\nHe told Mr Rubin about his dramatic escape when the camp was liberated by U.S. Army paratroopers. He said that he quickly grabbed his rucksack, got dressed and got out just before the burning roof collapsed.\n\nThe Last of the Doughboys, was released last week.\n\n@highlight\n\nInterviews with dozens of the last World War I veterans were conducted by Richard Rubin for his book, The Last of the Doughboys\n\n@highlight\n\nHe spent 10 years conducting interviews and research for the book", "By\nMike Dawes\n\nMichael Wasley sprang one of the Crucible's great upsets as he beat world No 2 Ding Junhui in the first round of the Dafabet World Championship.\n\nIn a midnight finish, Wasley prevailed 10-9 against China's great title hope after a breathtaking and hastily arranged third session.\n\nThey had been forced to go off with Ding lead 9-8 as the afternoon session ran over its allocated time, and an inspired Wasley seized the moment at the climax to the match, levelling with an impeccable 103 break and holding his nerve in an ultra tense 19th frame.\n\nShock: Ding Junhui (left) was beaten by Michael Wasley (right) in the first round at The Crucible\n\nDing had been seeded to meet Ronnie \nO'Sullivan in the semi-finals, but now one of the defending champion's \nmain obstacles has been removed.\n\nHe\n might yet run into 24-year-old Wasley from Gloucester, who belied his \ninexperience and world ranking of 73 to beat a man who has won five \nmajor ranking titles this season, tying a record set by Stephen Hendry \nover two decades ago.\n\nWasley sealed his win on the pink in the decider, and showed his delight as he pumped his fist.\n\nThere\n was another dramatic finale earlier in the evening session as Mark \nSelby edged through to the second round with a nail-biting 10-9 win over\n Michael White.\n\nSelby, who \nfinished runner-up at the Crucible in 2007, led his Welsh opponent 3-0, \n5-1 and 8-4 but White fought back to level 9-9 and take the match to a \ndeciding frame.\n\nNail biter: Mark Selby beat Michael White in a final frame decider at The Crucible\n\nNerve: Selby made a 57 break in the 19th frame to secure a tense victory\n\nIt was Selby\n though who held his nerve at the death, making a break of 57 to take \nthe decider and seal his place in the next round.\n\nFour-time champion John Higgins faces a fight to stay in the tournament as he trails Alan McManus 6-3 after the opening session.\n\nMcManus,\n who had beaten another former champion Mark Williams in the final \nqualifying round, lost the opening frame but came to win the next six in\n a row with commanding breaks of 87 and 74 along the way.\n\nHiggins\n hauled himself back into the contest by winning the last two frames but\n has an uphill task to progress when he continues on Tuesday morning.\n\nJoe Perry won six consecutive frames to come from 6-3 down to beat Joe Burnett 10-7.\n\nBreaks of 87, 55, 70, 51 and finally 81, ensured Perry's passage to the next round.\n\n@highlight\n\nDing Junhui beaten 10-9 by Michael Wasley in first round\n\n@highlight\n\nMark Selby sees off Michael White 10-9 at The Crucible"]
